Maybe a little too late to make a blog, but maybe not too late to share stories.<div><br /></div><div>So let me introduce myself, my name is Johannes Nicolaus Wibisana, you can call me Nico or Ocin. I go by those nicknames.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm Indonesian, I speak 3 languages: Bahasa Indonesia, English, Japanese. I studied Japanese for 9 months in Kyoto/Japan from July 2015 and that was where the fun actually started, and that's exactly why I thought it's kinda late to make this blog hahaha.</div><div><br /></div><div>Basically, I had interest in Biology since I was little, I brought it until now that I'm going to enroll in Osaka University's CBCMP (Chemistry Biology combined major program) starting from October 2016.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So, I am a biologist in the making. I am currently researching/interning at UPH which stands for Universitas Pelita Harapan until around September. So if you want to meet me before I go then... I suggest you come here!</div><div><br /></div><div><div>Now, why Japan? Out of all the countries that I could have studied in. I'm gonna write about it in the next post!&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I will also write about the process and stuff and how to make it into the land of the rising sun so stay tuned!</div>
